# A/B Testing

A/B testing <Citation id="abtesting" />, also known as online controlled experimentation or continuous experimentation, is a statistical hypothesis testing method used to compare two variants of a software component, user interface, or algorithm in a live system. The goal of A/B testing is to determine which variant performs better based on predefined metrics such as user engagement, click-through rates, or conversion rates.

### **1. Experiment Design**
A/B testing follows the principles of controlled experiments. It involves:
- **Formulating a Hypothesis**: A specific change is hypothesized to improve a key performance metric.
- **Randomized User Assignment**: Users are randomly assigned to one of two groups:
  - **Control Group (A)**: Receives the original version (baseline).
  - **Treatment Group (B)**: Receives the modified version.
- **Metric Definition**: Success criteria such as click rates, revenue per user, or session duration are determined.

### **2. Execution in a Live System**
Unlike traditional offline experiments, A/B testing occurs in production environments with real users:
- **Live Deployment**: Both versions run simultaneously.
- **Traffic Splitting**: User traffic is divided among the two variants, often using a 50/50 split.
- **Data Collection**: Real-time logging of user interactions, engagement, and other behavioral data.

### **3. Statistical Analysis**
A/B testing relies on statistical inference to determine whether observed differences are significant:
- **Hypothesis Testing**:
  - **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: No difference exists between the two versions.
  - **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)**: The treatment (B) has a statistically significant effect.
- **Statistical Tests**:
  - **t-Tests (Student’s t-test, Welch’s t-test)**: Used for comparing means of normally distributed metrics.
  - **Chi-Square Test**: Used for categorical data (e.g., click/no-click).
  - **Mann-Whitney U Test**: A non-parametric alternative when data is not normally distributed.
  - **Bayesian Methods**: Estimate the probability of improvement rather than relying solely on p-values.
- **Confidence Intervals**: Used to quantify the uncertainty of estimated effects.

### **4. Decision-Making**
Once the statistical analysis is complete, the results inform:
- **Feature Rollout**: If the treatment outperforms the control, it is deployed system-wide.
- **Iteration and Optimization**: If inconclusive, further tests with adjusted parameters may be conducted.
- **Rollback**: If the new variant performs worse, the control is retained.

## **Challenges in A/B Testing**
- **Selection Bias**: Users may not be perfectly randomized, leading to skewed results.
- **Network Effects**: User interactions may create dependencies across groups.
- **Multiple Testing Problem**: Running many tests increases the chance of false positives (Type I errors).
- **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Effects**: Short-term changes may not reflect long-term user behavior.

## **Applications in Software Engineering**
A/B testing is extensively used in:
- **Web and UI Design**: Evaluating different layouts, button placements, and user flows.
- **Algorithm Optimization**: Testing variations in search ranking, recommendation systems, and AI models.
- **E-commerce and Advertising**: Determining the best pricing, promotions, and ad placements.

A/B testing is a critical tool for data-driven decision-making, ensuring that changes are validated through empirical evidence before full deployment.
